				The world knows Sachin Tendulkar as the Master Blaster of Cricket.  <br>
				<br>
				Here are a few facts along with comparison with different legends in cricket to prove my point:

        <div class="average">
            <h1>Career Averages</h1>
            <div class="intro">
                <span>

					The following chart shows the batting averages throughut the career of six batsmen- Sachin, Bradman, Viv Richards, Dravid, Ponting and Kallis. Scroll over the chart to see the averages of the various players at a particular match in their career. See the legend on the right for reference.

            </div>
            <div class="intro">
                <span>
					Sir Don Bradman is incomparable here if seen by absolute numbers. He retired with an average of 99.75. Insane. But the fact that he played just 53 test matche in his career, is a major negative point. He was a brilliant and a very consistent batsman, but just did not play for long so as to fairly compare. THe other batsman are all very similar in terms of their growth and averages through the careers with all aveaging around the 45+ mark. Thus the criteria to judge here is longevity. Sachin wins in longevity outright. He played 664 international matches in his career. Most by any player ever. The second in out pool is RIcky Ponting, with 543. More than a 100 matches less than Sachin. Thus here, the criteria boils down to longevity and hence Sachin leads.
